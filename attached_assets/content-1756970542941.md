### Frequently Asked Questions

![](https://developer.icicibank.com/assets/images/faq-banner.svg)

How do I sign up for a developer account on ICICI Bank development portal?

_expand\_less_

On the developer portal, click the Sign up button at right top corner. The portal is a self-service tool that will guide you through account creation. After creating an account and accepting the ICICI Bank API Portal and Services Agreement, you can start developing apps.

Who is this for?

_expand\_less_

We are currently publishing this for new developers or existing partners with a new initiative. If you do not have an integration with ICICI Bank, use these APIs to get started.

Do I need to create a Developer Account to use your APIs?

_expand\_less_

You can sign up for a new Developer account and create an API key on your Developer Console. For more information, see our Documentation page. If you are an Enterprise Developer interested in adding or updating an application, please contact your Account Manager before creating an API key. If you are not able to access your Developer Console, contact your Account Manager.

What is an API?

_expand\_less_

API is the abbreviation for “Application Programming Interface”. An API allows a third party application to use a common set of services via a defined interface.

How do I obtain API keys?

_expand\_less_

Simply create an account on the developer portal and then create one or more applications. Each application will get its own API key. Once your application is ready to go live you can request for an account plan upgrade via your Developer Console.

What is OAuth?

_expand\_less_

OAuth is an authentication protocol. For more information, please visit oauth.net.

What is a REST API?

_expand\_less_

REST (Representational State Transfer) is a simple stateless architecture i.e. each operation is entirely defined by the information sent to and received from the service. When a web service uses this architecture, it is known as a REST API.

What are the Organisation Administrator’s responsibilities?

_expand\_less_

The Organisation Administrator is your company’s representative for the ICICI Bank Developer Portal. This person has overall responsibility for the ICICI Bank Developer Portal account, and has access to all the services and functions available on the site. The Organisation Administrator’s main responsibilities include:

- Adding, deleting and managing your organisation’s developers
- Adding, deleting and managing your organisation’s applications
- Editing organisational details
- Requesting API keys and authentication
- Changing API Plans or Account Plans
- Checking API usage and analytics.

The Organisation Administrator is ICICI's first point of contact regarding the ICICI Bank Developer Portal.

How do I add a user to my organization’s developer account?

_expand\_less_

Only users with the enterprise administrator role can add users. You can manage your users and permissions at User Managament page.

How do I handle any service errors that are returned?

_expand\_less_

You will see details of various error responses within the API specifications. The Error description field in a response is meant to detail a message for the user. Refer to the error code information which details what the error code means and how this error code should be handled.

What is an Account Plan?

_expand\_less_

An Account Plan is a collection of one or more APIs. Every developer organization has an Account Plan. When a developer registers for a new organization account, the organization is automatically assigned to ‘Bronze Account Plan’. Using ‘Bronze Account Plan’ you can only consume ‘Test’ APIs. In order to consume ‘Production’ APIs, you have to upgrade your account plan to ‘Production Account Plan’.

What is an API Plan?

_expand\_less_

An API Plan is a predefined set of rules and quotes of how to consume an API. Currently, we provide ‘Sandbox’ and ‘Production’ API plans. ’Test’ APIs are only available via ‘Sandbox API Plan’ and they are restricted to some quotes which means you will have limited access. On the other hand ‘Production’ APIs available via ‘Production API Plan’ can be consumed with higher quotes and they process live data. As mentioned under the title ‘What is an API Plan?’ you have to upgrade your account plan to ‘Production Account Plan’ in order to consume ‘Production’ APIs.

Is there a limit to the number of call APIs?

_expand\_less_

Yes, sandbox APIs are currently restricted to a limited number of calls, according to API Plan’s context.

What responsibilities do Developers have?

_expand\_less_

Developers have to be invited by their Organisation Administrator to join the portal. Once joined, they can access most of the same functions as the Organisation Administrator. There are a few things developers won’t be able to do, and this includes inviting other developers to join, changing API or Account plans, or editing organisational details.

What are your Account Plans?

_expand\_less_

Your organisation has a choice of two Account Plans:

- Our Standard Plan is a free service that gives you up to 10,000 hits per day over your applications and standard technical support through our portal.
- Our Premium Plan is a chargeable service that gives you a higher number of hits per day or hour - with enhanced, personalised technical support as well as the standard support available through our portal.

How do I change Account Plans?

_expand\_less_

If you’re an Organisation Administrator, you can change your Account Plan by going to Dashboard/Applications. Simply select your preferred plan under ‘Account Plan Change’ in the first table. We’ll automatically be notified of your request and be in touch with any further requirements we may need from you.

How do I move from Sandbox to Production?

_expand\_less_

If you’re an Organisation Administrator, you can request to move from Sandbox to Production for each API within a specific application using this portal:

- Go to Dashboard/Applications.
- Click on the cog icon next to your application and select ‘Edit’.
- Click on the ‘API Management’ tab.
- Under ‘API Plan Change’ select ‘Production’.

We’ll then be in touch with any further requirements we may need from you.

If I delete an application, can I retrieve it?

_expand\_less_

No, so please make sure you’re certain you don’t want the application before deleting it.

Can I put my application on hold, but keep my account open?

_expand\_less_

Yes. Go to Dashboard/Applications, click on the cog to the right of the application, then ‘Disable’.

Does my API key expire?

_expand\_less_

No. But your Application may be suspended or deleted which will suspend or delete the associated API key.
